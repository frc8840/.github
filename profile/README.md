## 2022 Season

In the 2022 Season, Rapid React, for our rookie year we built a robot that could pick up balls, shoot low hub, and can climb to the low bar. It was a great learning experience, and through this we grew a lot. We first competed at the San Francisco regional, coming in 39th out of 41. Although that place was low, we ended up winning the Rookie All Star award, putting on the waitlist for the First Robotics Championship. The week before the championship, we learned that we got off the waitlist, and we decided to go! At the championships, we met many teams and learned a lot. Here, we encountered many problems (our robot broke almost every match. The only match that it didn't break, the computer broke, delaying the game by 5 minutes ðŸ˜…), but we tried to contribute to our alliances as much as we could. Through this, we ended up winning the Championship Division Highest Rookie Seed Award, coming in 49th of 76 teams. Next year, we hope to do a lot more outreach, expand, and more!
